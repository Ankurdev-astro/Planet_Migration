# Planet_Migration
Based on my research project in Third Year of MSci Astrophysics at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL).

Abstract:
A massive planet opens a gap in protoplanetary disks through disk-planet interactions. The criteria for gap opening is based on torque balance and depends on mass of the planet. In this project, we aim to understand how fast a Jupiter mass planet has to drift such that it does not open a gap. This shall allow us to develop a limit on the planet’s migration speed to open a gap. This hydrodynamical problem is solved using a two-dimensional (2D) physical model and numerical approach. We use a Python package “Pyrodeo” which is an implementation of RODEO (ROe solver for Disk-Embedded Objects) and solve inviscid isothermal hydrodynamics. We simulate the system for different cases of migration speed and find that giant planets do not open gaps in disks in cases where they migrate at 30% of sound-speed or higher.
